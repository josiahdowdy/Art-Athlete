# PRIVACY POLICY & LEGAL

## Art Athlete PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy describes the policies of ART ATHLETE (collectively referred to hereunder as “Company” or “we,” “us,” or “AA”) regarding the information we collect or receive about our customers. It is applicable to josiahdowdy.github.io/Art-Athlete/ website and the apps that we make. ART ATHLETE is a company established in Alberta, Canada.

We provide this document to let you know the kinds of personal information we may gather, why we gather your information, what we use your personal information for, when we might disclose your personal information, and how you can manage your personal information.

When you provide personal information and/or Customer Data, you are consenting to the manner in which AA will collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage your personal information and Customer Data, as set out in this Privacy Policy.

If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our website or our apps.

## POLICY UPDATES

As our company and website continue to develop, we may add new services and features to our website or apps. If these additions affect our Privacy Policy, this document will be updated appropriately. That’s why we reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice.

# CONTACTING YOU

We will only send you email when responding to your support emails or for notifying you of important issues, such as security or bugs.

We do not, and never will, share or otherwise exchange your email address with third-parties

Our website and apps purchased through App Store may offer an opt-in email newsletter, through which we send occasional updates about new and updated products and special offers.

Each email you receive from a mailing list of ours will contain an unsubscribe link that will instantly remove you from that list. You can also contact us at artathlete@icloud.com to be removed from any or all of our mailing lists.

## DATA COLLECTION

One of the basic principles we are following in our apps and website is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you’ve requested. As a result, what information we collect and store depends almost entirely on how you choose to make use of our website and our apps.

In addition to information which you explicitly and knowingly provide, our website and apps may collect additional data, personal or non-personal, as expressed below.

We don’t share your data with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights.

## COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL DATA

Non-personal data is information that cannot be used to uniquely identify a specific individual.

## COLLECTION & USE OF PERSONAL DATA

Personal data is information that can be used to uniquely identify a specific individual.

Our server doesn’t collect any kind of personal user information (email, passwords, contact information, contacts, location…)

The only information we collect is about your drawings sessions and it is not tied to you. We want to use the data to give the best experience for users. For example, figuring out what the average amount of photos are drawn and how long each photo timer is set for will influence us to change the default settings in the app.

# ACCESS AND PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA

None.

## GOVERNING LAW

Canada law shall govern in any and all disputes, including privacy or defamation issues or otherwise.
