# Art Athlete

Art Athlete is an app for artists to load in their photos and set them on a timer so they can practice sketching and warm up for the day.

It is available on Mac, iPad and iPhone.

Sample photos are included with the app, but you can load in your own from your device by clicking the folder icon next to "Photos" on the left panel.
