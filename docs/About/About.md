Art Athlete lets you load your photos and set a timer so you can draw them one by one. 

For example, load in 20 pictures of your cat, then select 60 seconds for each one and hit Start. You have 60 seconds to sketch each cat.

Drawing in this way is a great way to warm up each day and to help you to draw faster.
