POLICY UPDATES \u00b6 As our company and website continue to develop, we may add new services and features to our website or apps. If these additions affect our Privacy Policy, this document will be updated appropriately. That\u2019s why we reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice. CONTACTING YOU \u00b6 We will only send you email when responding to your support emails or for notifying you of important issues, such as security or bugs. We do not, and never will, share or otherwise exchange your email address with third-parties Our website and apps purchased through App Store may offer an opt-in email newsletter, through which we send occasional updates about new and updated products and special offers.

DATA COLLECTION \u00b6 One of the basic principles we are following in our apps and website is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you\u2019ve requested.
